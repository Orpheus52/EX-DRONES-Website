<p5><h1 class="glow">EX-DRONES: NEXT-GEN IS OUT NOW! </h1> </p5>
<br><br><br><br>
<center><p4><br> The NEXT-GEN Update has finally arrived, bringing in a brand new EX-DRONES experience like never before.
TheSilentHouse_Studio & Cookie Studios, the developers behind the scenes have shared their thoughts and compared the Original EX-Drones, to EX-DRONES 
with the NEXT-GEN upgrade!</p4></center>



<center><p3><br>"EX-DRONES is the only project that took us about 4 years to make the game we wanted it to be. We've all been very optimistic for the project
there were harsh times, good times, and disasterous moments in this development hell. It was a carousel but we all wanted it to be the game we would look at
in the future and say "hey, this is a game that we created afterall". It's a wish that came true. I believe that the NEXT-GEN is a love letter to our EXTERS
aka, fans! The original build of the full game back in January 2022 was a simple preview of the full game. It was in an Early Access condition and received
criticism which we believe it was all facts about the current project. We came back into the project on December 4th 2022 we decided to come back again as 
we had some unfinished business with EX-DRONES. Back then we were getting better and better with the programming/coding and we realized how...well, not so well
of a UI the game had. You see, originally, NEXT-GEN was all about Enhancing the UI/Menu of the game. It was that time we realized we had a lot to be done.
The truth is that we thought it won't take so long so we assumed around in 2023 the upgrade would release. Well, we were wrong. It took us about 2 years to 
complete it. Personally i am very proud of what the team has accomplished." </p3></center>

Players can now take a trip to the new huge maps to discover high-tech weaponry (each designed to deliver a visceral and satisfying combat experience), enemies, secrets and upgrades. 
Engage in intense firefights against the DRONES and TURRETS a design by Johnathan, and the Soldiers, power-hungry men that betrayed humanity and were hired by Johnathan.
 With stunning graphics, innovative gameplay mechanics, and a pulse-pounding soundtrack by Had Funk & Waterflame, EX-DRONES thrusts players into a relentless and visually stunning sci-fi battlefield, 
 The future 2048 is here and awaits, and the fate of the universe is in your hands. </center> </p3>
